# HiddenGorgeTunnels

In certain games, particular rounds of Siege, unconnected Gorge tunnels tend to take over the minimap at the Hive Room.  This makes it particular aggravating to find connected tunnels going to particular areas of the map as you cannot tell where the connected minimap lines actually go.

To minimize this, this mod will hide all Minimap icons for unconnected tunnels allow for less of a polutted minimap.

1. Owners see their own tunnels regardless of state
2. Players on the same team as the owner of a tunnel will only see the Minimap Icons for the tunnel when it is connected.
2. Enemy players see the tunnels as per usual i.e.  Scans/Players looking at a tunnel will have the Icon show up for the enemy team.
